***************************************
What is the Ops Insights API Client?
***************************************

This is a quickly put together psr-4 compliant PHP SDK library that provides an easy way to access and use the Ops Insights API, whether through the standard endpoints, or a custom endpoint that we provide to a client.

If you are integrating with the Ops Insights API using a different programming language then this can serve as a good starting point as to how to layout a similar library for whatever language and framework you or your developers are using to access it.
